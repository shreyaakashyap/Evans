            <h1>Welcome to Evans Elementry</h1>
            <h2>A school in Spring Ford School District</h2>
            <p>Welcome to Evans Elementary School!

The Evans Elementary staff is dedicated to teaching your children the skills and personal habits they will one day need in order to be successful members of society. We are committed to a partnership with families and community in helping our children acquire the skills, attitudes, and dispositions which will enable them to define themselves as individuals. Our goal is to design an environment so that your children's experiences here will be educational, successful, safe and pleasant. Never hesitate to telephone, write, or visit should you have any questions about the school program. It is best to contact your teacher first; however the principal is happy to help you with your questions.
Your awareness of our school's goals and policies will make life easier for your children as they make the adjustment to their school. Our Elementary Student and Parent Handbook is designed to specifically explain those policies.
There is a great deal of collaboration between the staff and the Home and School League with respect to extracurricular activities. There will be Halloween, and other Holiday parties, and Book Fairs, just to name a few.
Communication is very important to us. Report card conferences are scheduled twice a year. Teachers write monthly news bulletins for parents, and frequently initiate phone consultations.
The characteristics which make a good family could very well be the same characteristics which make a good school. Believing this as we do, we try very hard to be child-centered. We strive to be aware of the children as individuals and to treat them that way.
Children learn best in a disciplined environment - "Firm, but gentle" is the password here. One of the responsibilities of the principal is to arrange the school environment so as to encourage desirable behavior and discourage undesirable behavior. We are reinforcing values which you stress at home. Values such as generosity, kindness, helpfulness, respect for the rights of others, and honesty. Our five rules at school are:
Show respect for others and their possessions.
Keep hands, feet and other objects to ourselves.
Use acceptable language.
Follow directions.
Do not prevent the teacher from teaching, or other students from learning.
"6 Day Cycle": Our daily schedule will be operating by way of a “6 DAY CYCLE,” as opposed to the traditional Monday through Friday concept. By using a 6 DAY CYCLE, we avoid missing special subjects (Art, Music, Physical Education, Library and RAM Quest) on days when school is not in session (snow days, vacation days, etc.). The first day of school will be “DAY 1,” as opposed to “MONDAY.” The second day of school will be “DAY 2;” the third day will be “DAY 3,” and so forth. The cycle will repeat itself every six days. In order to prevent any confusion, the “DAY” will be posted on our school calendar, as well as in classrooms and on our morning television announcements.</p>
